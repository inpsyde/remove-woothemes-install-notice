# Inpsyde Remove woothemes' install notice

Removes the admin notice that urges you to install the WooThemes installer.

As there are many plugins out there, that hooks in such a notice that is not removable, this plugin might miss some hook to remove. If you know about one an issue or pull request would be appreciated.
